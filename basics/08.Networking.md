<h1>Networking</h1>
TCP/IP is used for network communication.
TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol
IP stands for Internet Protocol

To communicate or to exchange the data we need a device called hosts

<h1>IP Networking</h1>
Hosts can communicate properly, only if it has 3 parts
1. IP address
2. Subnet mask
3. Broadcast address

IP address:
  192.53.43.167

Subnet mask:
  255.255.255.0
  
Broadcast address:
  192.53.43.255
  
<h2>IP Address</h2> 
IP address consists of 2 parts 

1. Network Address: Describes what network the host belongs to.

2. Host Address: Describes the specific host the data should be delevered to.

Different classes of networks

|  Class  |    Network         | Hosts Allowed |
| :-----: | :----------------: | :-----------: |
|    A    | 1.0 -> 127.0       |   16,777,216  |
|         |                    |               |
|    B    |128.0 -> 191.255    |    65,536     |
|         |                    |               |
|    C    |192.0.0->233.255.255|     255       |


Subnet Masks

|  Class  |   Subnet Mask      | 
| :-----: | :----------------: |
|    A    |      255.0.0.0     | 
|         |                    |            
|    B    |     255.255.0.0    |
|         |                    |           
|    C    |    255.255.255.0   |

Where the class A networks uses first octet for the network address and the last three for host address.
Class B networks uses first two octet for the network address and last two  octet for the host address.
Class C networks uses first three octet for the network address and last octet for the host address.

Broadcast Address

A broadcast address is a network address used to transmit data to all devices connected to a given network.

|  Class  |    Network         |  Subnet Mask  |    Broadcast   |
| :-----: | :----------------: | :-----------: | :------------: |
|    A    |     15.0.0.0       |   255.0.0.0   | 15.255.255.255 |
|         |                    |               |                |
|    B    |     185.189.0.0    |  255.255.0.0  |185.189.255.255 |
|         |                    |               |                | 
|    C    |    199.67.131.0    | 255.255.255.0 | 199.67.131.255 |

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
 CIDR allows networks to be sub-divided regardless of there traditional class. These sub-divided networks are called subnets.
